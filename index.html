  <h2>Baltic Sea</h2>
  <p>Baltic Sea, German Ostsee, Swedish Östersjön, Russian Baltiyskoye More, Finnish Itämeri, Polish Morze Bałtyckie, arm of the North Atlantic Ocean, extending northward from the latitude of southern Denmark almost to the Arctic Circle and separating the Scandinavian Peninsula from the rest of continental Europe. The largest expanse of brackish water in the world, the semienclosed and relatively shallow Baltic Sea is of great interest to scientists, while to historians it represents the economic core of the Hanseatic League, the great medieval trading group of northern European ports. The many names for the sea attest to its strategic position as a meeting place of many countries.
<br>
<br>
The Baltic Sea covers about 149,000 square miles (386,000 square km). The catchment area drained by the rivers bringing fresh water into the Baltic is about four times as large as the sea itself. The Baltic proper stretches southwest-northeast on the eastern side of the Scandinavian Peninsula from latitude 54° N to very near the Arctic Circle; its major axis, from eastern Denmark to southern Finland, is a little more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) long, with an average width of about 120 miles (190 km). The western Baltic extends north through insular Denmark and includes the Kattegat, a strait separating peninsular Denmark (Jutland, or Jylland) from southwestern Sweden. The Kattegat is bounded on the north by the Skagerrak, a deep inlet of the North Sea that separates southern Norway from northern Jutland.

The large islands of Bornholm (Denmark) and Öland and Gotland (Sweden) lie in the western Baltic, while the Åland Islands (Finnish: Ahvenanmaa), farther north, rise from a narrows between Sweden and Finland and mark the entrance to the arm of the Baltic known as the Gulf of Bothnia. Just to the south of the Åland Islands, the narrow Gulf of Finland stretches eastward between Finland to the north, Estonia to the south, and Russia around the eastern end, with St. Petersburg at its head. Proceeding clockwise from the west, the countries bounding the Baltic are Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany.

Marked seasonality is the principal feature of the Baltic climate. Winters are long and cold, and summers are short and comparatively warm. Mean temperatures range from about 14 °F (− 10 °C) over the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland in midwinter to about 63 °F (17 °C) over southern parts of the Baltic in midsummer. Variability is another facet of the climate. Mild maritime weather from the North Atlantic sometimes extends to the Baltic. At other times, continental influences are predominant, giving periods of severe cold in winter and warm, dry weather in summer. Precipitation varies with weather type, averaging 20 to 24 inches (about 500 to 600 mm) per year. Cloudy weather predominates, and fog is most frequent in spring and early summer. Winds tend to be variable and do not usually reach gale force. Sea breezes commonly occur over coasta

The coasts of Sweden and Finland are highly fretted and generally rocky, whereas those of the southern Baltic are flat and rather featureless. Where the crystalline rocks of the ancient rock mass of the Baltic Shield outcrop along the northern coasts, partly obscured by glacial drift and marine deposits, they are often fringed by the low, rocky islands known as a skerry guard. These are most numerous in the Saltsjön (Salt Bay) between Stockholm and the open waters of the Gulf of Bothnia and off the southwest coast of Finland. Off southeastern Sweden the narrow, elongated islands of Öland and Gotland consist of ancient limestone partly covered by sandy drift deposits. The rectangular island of Bornholm off southern Sweden was formed from a detached fragment of granite, and its high cliffs were shaped by faulting and shearing of the rock strata.

The coastal features of eastern Denmark are the outcome of Pleistocene glaciation and of subsequent changes in sea level. The east coast of Jutland, north of the Djursland peninsula, is smooth and low-lying. To the south are shallow bays divided by low promontories. In the area around Schleswig, shallow straight-sided fjords (Förden) occur, and the Flensborg Fjord (Flensburger Förde) forms part of the boundary between Denmark and Germany. The islands of the Danish archipelago have a broken coastline, with a number of shallow inlets and also bars, notably the Odense bar on the island of Funen. Where terminal moraines (deposits marking the farthest extent of glaciers) reach the sea, low promontories are formed. Solid rock seldom outcrops, except for the moderate-sized chalk cliffs along the eastern coast of the island of Møn.
